<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size: 0.94em;">
I have been a CS researcher at the <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/">CS</a> department, UChicago, IL. <br> 
My general research interests are in reliability and performance of systems (broadly construed), at the intersection of Systems and AI/ML.<br> 
My focus areas relate to hardware reliability and application performance modeling on diverse architectures and computing systems.     

<br><br>
Prior to UChicago, I was a CS post-doc at Stanford University, 
did a PhD in CS at NC State University, and a master's in CS at IITB, India. 
Even before that, I was a CS undergrad affiliated with WBUT, Kolkata, India.

<br><br>
I am originally from Siliguri, a city nested at the base of the Himalayas in North Bengal, India.
